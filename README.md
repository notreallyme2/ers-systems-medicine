If you'd like to view the Jupyter notebooks on Bitbucket (i.e. view them here without downloading), there is a Chrome extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bitbucket-nbviewer-button/pmffdaflalienoekibbmcblmabgkcoac)  
Obviously, you will need to be using Chrome(!)  
Then click `Source`, then click on an `ipynb` file; look for the `NBView` button (up and to the right of the source code window).
